V. VIEWING ACTIVITY

I. CREATING AN ACCOUNT
Users must create an account in order to use SoundingBoard. They can do this through the Register page, found in the navigation bar upon accessing the site. They must provide a unique username (that has not already been taken), a unique email address, and a password (which they must then again confirm). If any of these criteria are not met, an error message will appear, and the user will have to start the registration process again.

Upon creating a valid account, the site will send a welcome message to the email address provided, and the user will be logged into SoundingBoard. Users may log out and log back in at any time using the Log Out and Log In functionalities of the navigation bar respectively. Upon logging back in, the user will be prompted for a username and password. After registration, and in subsequent visits after log in, users will be directed to the Home Page, which features the SoundBoard banner logo as well as another welcome message.

II. USING THE SOUNDBOARD

Our soundboard, found on the ‘Soundboard’ page, features rows of buttons, one for each sound. Each button has the name of the sound that it plays written on it. To play a sound, users can click on a button. Users can click on buttons multiple times and can click on different buttons one after another — in other words, they may interact with the soundboard by clicking on the buttons in whatever order they see fit to create the sequence of sounds that they want. 

III. UPLOADING NEW SOUNDS

Users also have the functionality to add new sounds to the soundboard. To do this, they can visit the ‘Audio’ page. Here there is a space to enter the name of the new sound, which is what will appear as the title of this sound’s button. Then, there is also a button that allows you to upload a new file. In order for this to work properly, the uploaded audio file name should not contain any spaces. If these steps are followed and the submit button is pressed, then the sound will be added to the soundboard.

IV. MANAGING YOUR PROFILE

Your profile gives you an overview of your account and also allows you to personalize your space on SoundingBoard. In order to access your profile page, click on your username, displayed in the top right corner of the navigation bar. On mobile/tablet versions, this may be the bottom element in the dropdown menu.

{Changing your password}
If a user would like to change their current password, they can do so via the ‘Change Password’ page found in the navigation menu. Here, the user will be prompted to enter their current password, before selecting a new password and later confirming this new password. Once these fields are completed, the user may press the “Change” button. If the password change was successful, the user will be directed to a new page that says “Password was successfully changed!”

{Changing your email}
If a user would like to change their current email, they can do so via the ‘Change Email” page found in the navigation menu. The process for this is similar to the process for changing the password. Upon successful completion, a confirmation message indicating the change will be sent to the original email, outlining what the new email is, so that the user will know if their email has been changed by a malicious actor.

{Selecting a favorite sound}
Users can select and display their favorite sound in the profile section as well. The default is “None” but then users can use the dropdown menu, which displays all the possible sound names with the current favorite sound at the top, to select their favorite sound. After selecting the sound, users should press the “Change” button to save the updated favorite sound.

{Most played sound}
The profile page also displays the sound that the user has currently played the most times in the soundboard. Alongside it, the number of times that that sound has been played will be displayed in parentheses. If the user has not played any sounds yet, “None” will instead be displayed.

V. VIEWING ACTIVITY 

{Viewing your own activity}
In order to see a comprehensive history of the sounds that you have played, access the ‘Play History’ page, found on the navigation bar. Here, in order from last played to first played, are the sounds that the current user has ever played using the soundboard.  For each sound, the official name of the sound is listed as well as the date and time (in Coordinated Universal Time) at which the sound was played.

{Viewing other users’ activity}
Users can go to the ‘Social’ page to see information about other users’ activity on the site. Here, there is a table that displays the username, favorite sound, most played sound, and last played sound for each user that has created a valid account on the site. 

{Viewing other users’ profiles}
On the ‘Social’ page, users can click on the usernames of other users of the website in order to bring them to a page where one can see that user’s username, favorite sound, most played sound, last played sound, bio, and email.
